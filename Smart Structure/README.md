# Smart Structure
## Concept
This code is to control up to nine (9) different heating elements which are powered via an external power source and a relay. There is also 
single DC motor and quadrature encoder control, which are used to acutate the structure. 

## Sub-routines
Included are sub routines for:
- Clockwise motor rotation
- Counterclockwise motor rotations
- Encoder functionality 

## Project information
The code was used to control a three (3) module, with three (3) jointed memebers each, structure I developed that can achieve various
shapes and trajectories using simple cable acuation, depending on the configuration of rigid and jointed members. More information can be
found [here](). All research, concepts, and IP is property of Dr. Jianguo Zhao and the Adaptive Robotics Laboratory, Colorado State 
University.
