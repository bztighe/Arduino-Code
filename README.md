-[Walking Robot Motors](https://github.com/bztighe/Arduino-Code/tree/master/Tighe/walking%20robot) Functioning and properly tuned Arduino code that uses PID (Proportion-Integral-Derivative) to accurately control velocity and displacement of four DC microgear motors with magnetic quadrature encoders. Note: This code will not work on an UNO board, as you need at least four (4) interrupt pins (such as on a MICRO or LEONARDO).

-[Smart Structure](https://github.com/bztighe/Arduino-Code/tree/master/Smart%20Structure) Arduino code to control up to nine (9) relay switchs for a specific time (to apply current to structure) and specific displacement of one DC gear motor using quadrature encoder. 

-[5 Motor CNC control](https://github.com/bztighe/Arduino-Code/tree/master/TCA%20Machine) Code to control 5 motors via RAMPS1.4 shield/system for Arduino MEGA, adapted for use on a Twisted Coil Acuator (TCA) manufacturing machine. Code includes five (5) functions necessary for making TCA's including: Coil, Mandrel Only, Home Travelers, Move Z, and Twist. Also a Reverse option for each function as well as a five (5) step velocity control.
