-[Walking Robot Motors](https://github.com/bztighe/Arduino-Code/tree/master/Tighe/walking%20robot) Functioning and properly tuned code that uses PID (Proportion-Integral-Derivative) to accurately control velocity and displacement of two DC microgear motors with magnetic quadrature encoders.

-[Smart Structure](https://github.com/bztighe/Arduino-Code/blob/master/Smart%20Structure/VoltageTimeController.ino) Arduino code to control up to (9) relay switchs for a specific time (to apply current to structure) and specific displacement of one DC gear motor using quadrature encoder.
