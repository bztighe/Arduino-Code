# Laser Alert System
## Concept
As part of a Biomedical engineering problem, we were tasked to developing a more easily accessible alert system for an ALS patient. We opted to use a laser system as it takes zero force to activate, and is adaptable for a small switch of just a few inches to a longer one of many feet, depending on the specific application. 

## Sub-routines
This very simple class is always running and in the main loop as long as there is power to the device (currently uses USB power). There
are a couple sub-routines embedded:
- Volume control
- Number of beeps per trigger

## Project Information 
This system was built using a generic Arduino micro, a 5V laser transmitter, a laser reciever module, a passive buzzer and a PVC housing. The entire project can be built for under 20$.
